# Complexity-Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms
This repository contains a Flask web application that allows users to visualize the performance of various sorting algorithms. Users can generate random arrays of specified lengths, choose different sorting algorithms, and view the sorted array along with the execution time. The application also provides a comparison feature to measure and compare the execution times of multiple sorting algorithms.

Features
Home Page: Select a sorting algorithm and visualize the sorting process with random arrays.
Comparison Page: Compare the execution times of different sorting algorithms using Google Charts.
Supported Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort
Heap Sort
Quick Sort
Quick Sort with 3-Median
Selection Sort
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithms-visualizer.git
cd sorting-algorithms-visualizer
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
Running the Application
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the application.

Usage
Home Page
Enter the desired length of the array.
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Click "Submit" to see the sorted array and execution time.
Comparison Page
Enter the desired length of the array.
Click "Compare" to see a comparison of execution times for all supported sorting algorithms.
