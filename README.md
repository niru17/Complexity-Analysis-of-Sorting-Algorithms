# Complexity-Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms
This repository contains a Flask web application that allows users to visualize the performance of various sorting algorithms. Users can generate random arrays of specified lengths, choose different sorting algorithms, and view the sorted array along with the execution time. The application also provides a comparison feature to measure and compare the execution times of multiple sorting algorithms.

Features
Home Page: Select a sorting algorithm and visualize the sorting process with random arrays.

Comparison Page: Compare the execution times of different sorting algorithms using Google Charts.

Supported Sorting Algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Heap Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Quick Sort with 3-Median
7. Selection Sort
  
Getting Started: 

Prerequisites: 
- Python 3.x
- Flask

Installation:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/niru17/Complexity-Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms.git

cd Complexity-Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms

Install the required packages:

- pip install Flask
- 
Running the Application

Start the Flask server:

python app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to the application.

Usage: 

Home Page
Enter the desired length of the array.
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Click "Submit" to see the sorted array and execution time.
Comparison Page
Enter the desired length of the array.
Click "Compare" to see a comparison of execution times for all supported sorting algorithms.
