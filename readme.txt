Implementation Steps
----------------------
1. Make sure you have python installed on your PC.
2. Install the above-specified packages using pip.
3. Run python alogrithm.py in your command prompt.
4. Paste the link to chrome to get to the homepage.
5. Input the size of the array and select the algorithm
6. Click the sort button
7. In order to compare the algorithms based on input size and time complexity, click ‘To compare algorithms’ at the top of the page.
8. Enter the input size and click ‘Click to Compare’ to compare and get the graph
9. It redirects you to a new page where the result is displayed.
